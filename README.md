# student-portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a student portfolio that employers can view and interact with. The portfolio contains a navigation bar with buttons that scroll down to the corresponding section when clicked on. Each project has a section and is linked to the project itself. There is also a link to my resume and LinkedIn profile.
